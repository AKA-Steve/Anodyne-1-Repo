Questions about how the code works or how to run the game will be answered here (if people ask questions).

Q: What's Intra mean?

A: It was the early codename for Anodyne.


Q: Can this game be compiled for Mac or Linux?

A: Yes, but I'm not including instructions on how to do so or what IDEs to use (since I don't know). Anodyne is a standard Flash AS3 project that uses Adobe AIR, so most methods of compilation will work for it. For Mac you can build the SWF on Windows and then package it on Mac using Adobe AIR SDK's command line tools. I'm not really sure about Linux.

Q: Can I sell a project made with these assets?

A: Read the License.
