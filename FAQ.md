Questions about how the code works or how to run the game will be answered here (if people ask questions).

Q: Are you not selling the game anymore?

A: We are still selling the game. As the license says, you may not distribute a compiled, unaltered version of this game on a storefront/hosting site/etc for free or for money. As the license says, you can only download and use the game assets if you are an owner of a paid copy of Anodyne.


Q: What's Intra mean?

A: It was the early codename for Anodyne.


Q: Can this game be compiled for Mac or Linux?

A: Yes, but I'm not including instructions on how to do so or what IDEs to use (since I don't know). Anodyne is a standard Flash AS3 project that uses Adobe AIR, so most methods of compilation will work for it. For Mac you can build the SWF on Windows and then package it on Mac using Adobe AIR SDK's command line tools. I'm not really sure about Linux.

Q: Can I sell a project made with these assets?

A: Read the License.
