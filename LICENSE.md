Anodyne License v1.0
Last updated April 4th, 2020
Adapted from VVVVVV's source code license.

If you think something ought to be changed reach out to Melos Han-Tani at hello@analgesic.productions

If you are interested in distributing work that falls outside the terms in the licence below, or if you are interested in distributing work that includes using any part of Anodyne not included in this repo then please get in touch - we can discuss granting a licence for that on a case by case basis. The purpose of making the contents of this repo available is for others to learn from, to inspire new work, and to allow the creation of new tools and modifications for Anodyne, and to allow commercial/noncommercial derivative works (fan games, etc).

This notice may not be removed or altered from any source, binary or asset distribution.

This repo contains the source code for Anodyne, including all level, art, music, sound, and text content from the game.

The license contains two parts, pertaining to the source code assets, and then level/art/music/sound/text assets separately.

You may only make use of these assets and source code for 

- Derivative games (Fangames, Mods, Improved versions)
- Teaching/education purposes, self-education

These assets may not be used for movies, films, advertisements, or any other type of media without written permission.

Please note that to use these assets you must own a paid copy of Anodyne. This works on the honor system, but if you lie, we'll know.

I am choosing to include the assets here directly out of trust: most open sourced games make you copy the assets from an installed purchased version. As we still rely on Anodyne sales for our livelihood, please don't break this rule!


Part 1: Anodyne Asset Library (Art, Level, Music, Sound, Text assets)
-------------

The Asset Library of Anodyne consists of mp3, wav, txt, csv, xml, png, etc files inside of bin/, mp3/, sfx/, src/xml, src/csv, src/res and src/data, as well as the .dam level data files.

The Asset Library for Anodyne falls under a CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) with the additional restrictions:

- You must own a paid copy of Anodyne to use the art assets for derivative work
- You may not use any of the assets in a way that would infringe upon the Anodyne game copyright by creating a product that may be mistaken for Anodyne (e.g. you may not compile the unaltered game and rename it "Andoyne" and sell it).
- You may not redistribute any of the unaltered assets in standlone packages, in a way primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. This includes but is not limited to: selling the art in 'asset packages', selling the music on music distribution platforms.
- You may not redistribute any of the unaltered assets for free without prior written permission (e.g., you may not create a "Anodyne Sprites" itch.io product page. Use your best judgment: if the edits you're making are not significantly different, you shouldn't redistribute it for free (e.g. tinting spritesheet slightly)). If you're not sure, please reach out to us and ask.
- Any COMMERCIAL, derivative work using these assets must include an acknowledgement visible to all users of the product (e.g. title screen of a game or game's store page) that it includes used assets that are copyright of Analgesic Productions LLC and are from the Anodyne asset library.
- The origin of these assets must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you created the original assets.

Basically don't resell our stuff as if it was yours, and make sure to give credit where it's due!


Part 2: Anodyne Source Code 
-------

This software available from here is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any claim, damages or other liability arising from the use or in connection with this software. 

All materials in the repo, with the exception of the contents of the "org", "awerwer", "ca", "com", and "extension" directories under "intra/", are copyright of Analgesic Productions LLC 2013-2020.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software and to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:

- Any branch/fork/etc of this code for slight modding or improvement (e.g. "60 fps version" or "harder bosses mod") purposes must include this license and must require its users to own a paid copy of the original game.
- A branch/fork/etc of this code for significant modding purposes (think Mario Romhacks) does not require its users to own a paid copy of the original game. Use your best judgment here.
 - You may not alter or redistribute any unaltered versions of this software in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to, selling unaltered versions of this software, or including advertisements of any kind in unaltered versions of this software.
 - The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a product, you are required to include an acknowledgement in the product that this software is the copyright of Analgesic Productions LLC and is based on the Anodyne source code.
 - Altered source/binary versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being the original software.
 - You must not distribute any materials from the game which are not included in this repo unless approved by us in writing. 

Basically, making commercial or noncommercial mods or fangames using our code is fine. Just let your users know that you can't play an "improvements" mod of this game without owning the original game. However a mod on the scale of all-new levels/dialogue would not require the user to own the original game.

Also please don't do stuff like reskin the game with color-tinted sprites and sell it on Steam!! ...or else...
