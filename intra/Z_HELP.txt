Mobile notes

- RunMobile will run Anodyne with mobile metadata on
- dont update the fucking certificate!! android wont let you update otherwise
- mPackageApp.bat creates the apk. use included runtime. choose option 3
- Requires Flex 4.6 and Adobe AIR 30,0. Set that in flashdevelop's properties. Because Flex includes an old AIr version, copy paste AIR 30.0 into the flex folder. also edit jvm.ini or something in the bin folder to have 1024 memory. reload flashdevelop to make it work.
- Still not sure how to do 64 bit iOS

iOS:
- Add back sound things in Main and Intra
- Caveats
- Make sure "1" and "2" set in supported  profiles 
- Make srue expanded resolution is on
- Make srure have correct dimension images, all the icons
- Testflight: make sure everyone is always added

- Make sure the auto-home-kill-app is off

WINDOWS:
	- Make sure that the code for detecting joyquery in Main.as is running.
	-Run the nsi script 
	-SWF VERSION 13!!! CHECK COMPILER OPTIONS

	-SWF VERSION 13!!!
		- 2017/2/4 - maybe this doesn't matter...?
	-CHECK COMPILER SOPTIONS
	- Make sure the joyquery CODE DOESNT RUN or it'll crash
	- I guess I need to run adt on a mac.
	- Make sure the PackageApp_Mac.bat is run, as it will use the app descriptor that includes the macjoy stuff
	- The above .bat needs to run on a mac and have JDK and the air SDK installed (3.3 I used)
	- For some reason, SWF 20 and Air 3.7 (Even earlier )give me fullscreen flickering on Mac 10.12 (Sierra) - oh well
	- Note that usually windows compiles the game from source then the bin/ ane/ bat/ etc files are copied to a mac to be packaged with a cert
	- Might need to re-gen a cert (I did that) using adt -certificate 
	
LINUX:
	-Flex 4.5A Air 2.6
	-SWF VERSION 11!!!
	- Make sure the joyquery code doesn't run.
