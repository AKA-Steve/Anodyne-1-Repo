Here's a list of all things that can be done for polish, if time allows.

By time allows, I mean AFTER
All level design, SFX, music, tilesets, animations, dialogue, entity programming
are done.
Concurrently with testing is probably okay.

1. REDCAVE boss burns away when dying - this would be done programmatically but Marina can pick the colors.
2. HOTEL boss's pupil/iris or whatever follows your movement. Involves splitting the sprite into 3 layers - base, eyelid, eye..thing.
xxx3. The HOTEL boss periodically appears in water throughout the dungeon at a random chance.
5. on TITLE SCREEN, starting the game, the current frame is split into rectangles and squares and shattered
6. Bonus pictures and short song clips with the collected cards
